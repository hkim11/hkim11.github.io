        <div class="carrot">
       <P>Cheryl Carmona and Aliza Sollins started Boone Street Farm in Fall 2010, in the East Baltimore Midway neighborhood out of the simple desire to have a large space to grow fresh produce.  The project quickly blossomed and Boone Street Farm became a space for children to play, neighbors to garden, fellow gardeners to cultivate, local artists to create art, neighbors to gather, and more!</P>
